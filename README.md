# Introduction
This lab guides us to gain practice with documentation, by taking careful notes and posting a setup guide on Github, then we would take a deep dive into the programmable I/O (PIO) module
# 3.3
The scans of my annotated code printouts(ws2812.c and generated/ws2812.pio.h) can be found [here](https://github.com/Chenwei-Tang/ese5190-2022-lab2-into-the-void-star/blob/main/Part3/3.3.pdf)

# Brief responses to the reading questions in 3.2
• Why is bit-banging impractical on your laptop, despite it having a much faster processor than the RP2040?<br>
The processor isn’t really designed for this. It has other work to do. As processors have become faster in terms of overwhelming number-crunching brute force, the layers of software and hardware between the processor and the outside world have also grown in number and size. In response to the growing distance between processors and memory, PC-class processors keep many hundreds of instructions in-flight on a single core at once, which has drawbacks when trying to switch rapidly between hard real time tasks.<br>
• What are some cases where directly using the GPIO might be a better choice than using the PIO hardware?<br>
LEDs and push buttons<br>
• How do you get data into a PIO state machine?<br>
The pull instruction takes one data item from the transmit FIFO buffer, and places it in the output shift register (OSR). Data moves from the FIFO to the OSR one word (32 bits) at a time. <br>
• How do you get data out of a PIO state machine?<br>
The state machine needs to be told which GPIO or GPIOs to output to. There are four different pin groups which are used by different instructions in different situations. The OSR is able to shift this data out, one or more bits at a time, to further destinations, using an out instruction. The out instruction here takes one bit from the data we just pull-ed from the FIFO, and writes that data to some pins.<br>
• How do you program a PIO state machine?<br>
A method ws2812_default_program_config configures a PIO state machine based on user parameters.<br>
• In the example, which low-level C SDK function is directly responsible for telling the PIO to set the LED to a new color? How is this function accessed from the main “application” code
```
typedef void (*pattern)(uint len, uint t); It is accessed by pattern_table[pat].pat(NUM_PIXELS, t);
```
• What role does the pioasm “assembler” play in the example, and how does this interact with CMake?<br>
Gloss over the details of how the assembly program in the .pio file is translated into a binary program, ready to be loaded into the PIO state machine. pioasm can also be used directly, and has a few features not used by the C++ SDK, such as generating programs suitable for use with the MicroPython PIO library.<br>
# Reflect on the tools
•What were some strengths/weaknesses of working with paper?<br>
It can be easily writen but hard to store and review<br>
•What were some strengths/weaknesses of working with spreadsheets?<br>
We can search the information easily but it takes a lot of time to complete<br>
•How might you approach this task using other tools available to you? <br>
I use Wavedrom to help me draw the sequence diagram<br>
