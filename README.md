My write up, scanned hand models and annotate code are included in the pdf's attached. Next is an excel sheet containing all the charts for the lab. Lastly a gif of my working code blinking the LED and sending a serial message. I kept all the pictures and writeups in pdf form bc that was easiest for me rather than having to reformat on github.
