        Modeling response: 
                What basic circuitry does a WS2812 LED need to operate?

                Intelligent digital port data latch, signal reshaping amplification drive circuit, precision internal oscillator, 12V voltage programmable constant
                current control.
                
                How do you send a single 1 or 0 bit to the WS2812?

                Wide positive pulse for 1, narrow positive pulse for 0, very long negative pulse for latch enable.
                
                How do you tell a WS2812 youâ€™re done sending data?

                A long negative pulse latches the pixel data into the LEDs (RESET).

        What were some strengths/weaknesses of working with paper?

        Working with paper really makes you focus to understand what is happening from a conceptual level. However, this ends up
        taking a lot of time.
        
        What were some strengths/weaknesses of working with spreadsheets?

        Excel can organize a great amount of registers in a clean format. However, it's not convenient to draw.
        

        I think the data sheet of 2040 and the data sheet of C SDK are very good sources to understand the data transmission mode and working principle of each       
        register.
