    Tested on: Windows 10 Home

# Overview
In this lab, we will set up our laptops/PC for QT PY RP2040 development using C/C++ SDK. We will first set up our devices with the required environment. Then we will learn the basis of programmable I/O (PIO) modules by studying the RP2040 datasheet, pico SDK datasheet and any other references avaliable online. Finally, we will build our own serial console that interact between user input and onboard Neopixel.

# Set up
The [set up guide](https://github.com/shux3/ese5190_lab2_setups/blob/main/README.md) is based on laptop with Windows Home System shown as below:

  |System        |               Windows 10 Home                   |
  |--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
  |System Version|			21H2			   |
  |System Type	 |   64-bit operating system, x64-based processor  |
  |Processor     |Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-9300H CPU @ 2.40GHz 2.40 GHz|
  
  Notice that there are more than one tools to get your own PC ready for the development using C/C++ SDK.
