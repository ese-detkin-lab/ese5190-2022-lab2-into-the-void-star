## Overview 

This repo is for Lab 2A in ESE5190@Penn, mainly covering up the PIO and a process to develop a gradually precise model for a simple PIO example: light up a WS2812 LED on Adafruit Qt Py RP2040 board.

## Q&A for PIO

Before going into details about how the PIO is handling codes using all kinds of registers, we first going through a Q&A session which leads us to the essential and advance of the PIO on Raspberry Pi RP2040 chips.

**Q: Why is bit-banging impractical on your laptop, despite it having a  much faster processor than the RP2040?**

A: First, the conflicts between the fast speed of CPU and the rather slow speed of I/O determine the low-efficiency of using a bit-bang methods on laptop. Every time when a peripheral requires the CPU to handle the I/O through bit-bang, it must first using Interrupt to block CPU from what it is current working and switch to the I/O task, which is so inefficient for calling such an interrupt several within an I/O task due to the low speed of the peripheral. Every time, the CPU have to preserve the scene and deposit current work, switch to handle the I/O which needs a long time, and come back to recover what has been deposited, which use up some register and caches that is resource-consuming as well.

Second, CPU on laptop nowadays are working under a much more complex system than microcontrollers, which means the CPU would keep many hundreds of instructions in-flight on a single core at once, which has drawbacks when trying to switch rapidly between hard real time tasks.

**Q: What are some cases where directly using the GPIO might be a  better choice than using the PIO hardware?** 

A: Some burst I/O needs may be better to satisfy when handling them using GPIO. Also, some tasks without strict requirement for  cock synchronization would also be simpler to deal with using GPIO. In the case of lighting up a WS2812 LED, send a signal contains a high voltage to power the WS2812, which is not strict restricted to the timing and clocks, is solved by deploying a GPIO interface.

**Q: How do you get data into/out from a PIO state machine?** 

A: Getting data into a PIO state machine would us the TX FIFO register for the intended PIO machine while getting data from the PIO state machine is basically an `OUT` instruction to transfer data from Out Shift Register(OSR) to Scratch register X or Y, which is binding with a specific PIN as the output destination.

**Q: How do you program a PIO state machine?**

A: To program a PIO state machine, we would better make full use of the PIO asm-like instructions to make up a `.pio` file containing the the definition of a PIO module. Besides, we should also configure the CMake environment to build and make this PIO file using the SDK provided by Raspberry for RP2040.

## Flow of the PIO

For the task to light up a WS2812 LED, the C code and the auto-generated header from PIO is annotated here.

Follow the number annotated with the code, we could build up a basic view of the data flow of the PIO transmitting data to WS2812 LED. Also, it is possible to track the value within the registers inside the PIO. At the time when color data has been written to TX FIFO before the state machine transfer them to the LED, the value inside some registers are listed as follows:

## Modeling Time

After going into details in a temporary state of the PIO state machine, we could have a more high-level view on how the PIO sending one single bit to the WS2812.

First, we would also going through the techniques details of the WS2812 LED.

WS2812 uses a non-return-to-zero protocol to communicate with other hardware: the length of the time period a high voltage continues identifies two different digits. When the high voltage lasts 0.7us and followed by a low voltage input lasts 0.6us would be recognized as digit 1. When the high voltage lasts 0.35us, which is shorter than the length of digit 1's high voltage input, followed by a low voltage input lasting 0.8us would be recognized as digit 0.

WS2812 receives the color data in the GRB order, which is different from normal RGB order. It would take the first 24 bit of the data from PIO state machine and ignore the following 8 digits in the whole 32 bits package. For the first 8 bit of the received 24 bit data, it is recognized as data for Green channel, and the second and thrid 8 digits for Red and Blue channels respectively.

The connection between WS2812 and the RP2040 is wired connection. More specific, the input pin of the WS2812 is the DI pin, which is the PIN 12 on Adafruit Qt Py RP2040. After assigning this PIN 12 to the output of side set in the PIO0, the data could be transferred through side set instructions. Before sending data to WS2812, we should first send high voltage to its power PIN to power it on, in which we adopt GPIO to handle with.

Also, WS2812 provides a cascade connection mode, which means the input of a unit in the chain is the output from DO PIN from the previous unit, which is also 24 bit.

Then, with the combination of WS2812's technique characteristics, we could develop a time diagram for the PIO responsible for transferring data to WS2812.

After  drawing the time diagram above,  let's take several time to summary.

First, the time diagram above start when the data is ready at the TX FIFO for the state machine, and ends when the first bit is sent to the GPIO pin to the WS2812. Since for different bit the PIO sent the situation may be different, here we use different color to identify different bits: red stands for a single bit 1 and blue stands for a single bit 0.

About the method used here: drawing charts on iPad using an Apple Pencil, which is more direct than checking the digits inside the registers to guess the status of the state machine. But the time delay here could not be depicted very precise, which may affect the control of clock. Also, when drawing directly could give us a comprehensive view of the whole process sending a single bit through PIO, but we cannot obtain some essential information   inside the registers, such as whether there is a IRQ for microcontroller from peripheral or not. On the contrary, spreadsheet, which accurately record every digit inside the register, could give us opportunities to speculate the digits inside the registers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

At last, the time period depicted here is one state machine clock, which is not precise enough, so there may not be some obvious delay on signals. But this could be visible when we zoom in to a much more trivial timer period, for example, $\frac{1}{4}$ state machine clock. And we will going into details about in the next chapter.

## Zooming in & Time Diagram

After speculation on the PIO state machine register values and chart of the data for one bit, we could form a more comprehensive view of the process to a whole color data package which has a size of 32 bits.

First, some of the register values are available through the whole sending process [here](/assets/3.6-320.xlsx).

Then, based on the time model from previous section and the register values, we could form an integral time diagram for sending the whole color package.

In this time diagram, the `clock` here has a larger time interval representing the time used for sending one bit to WS2812.

## Hello Blinkenlight

In the final part of lab 2A, we present a new interactive WS2812 program enabled by PIO for LED and USB Serial input and output. 

The main idea of this program is to creating an interactive interface through the terminal, waiting for users to input the RGB color in hex form they are going to put on the WS2812 LED light. After checking the input is valid for a color input, this program would transfer the RGB form input data to GRB order using bitwise operation. Then, the GRB ordered data could be transmitted to WS2812 through PIO to finally light the LED up in the assigning color. If the user does not input the color data within the time limit of 4 seconds, the program would use USB Serial output to display a message to the terminal. Also, if the user's input is not valid, for example, containing characters except the 16 hexadecimal digits, the program would also reminder the user to re-input a valid color data.

The interactive result could be viewed as follows:

Since the program here is a combination of USB Serial input and output and the PIO peripheral output, the CMake of this program should include both the libraries USB serial would use and the dependencies PIO module would use while also enable the USB Serial input and output in CMake file.  Besides, under the instruction of the lab material, we also encapsulate the `ws2812.c` into a header which could be included as a external library in CMake and C file. 

For the implementation, since the power of WS2812 is required to be set to high during the time period where light on, we need to implement a GPIO to be responsible sending high voltage to the power pin of WS2812 LED. Moreover, the transform of color data from RGB order to GRB order is done by using logic AND to extract value of each channel and using bitwise shift to change the order of the channels.
